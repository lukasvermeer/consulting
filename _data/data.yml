    summary: |
        Lukas Vermeer is an experienced experimentation practitioner. His specialty is designing and building the infrastructure and processes required to start and scale A/B testing to drive business growth. 

        Lukas combines industry experience in online experimentation and data science with an academic background in computing science and machine learning. For eight years, he was responsible for A/B testing at Booking.com, widely acknowledged leader in online experimentation. Lukas grew the Booking.com in-house experimentation team from four to thirty people, and became the first Director of Experimentation in the company.

        Lukas plays an essential role in making A/B testing an integrated part of business processes. He is an advocate for accessibility of experimentation, helping people from any background (product owners, designers, developers, writers) to make the right decisions. His impact was recognised in the Harvard Business Review story "Building a Culture of Experimentation" (March - April 2020 issue).

        Lukas co-authored multiple influential academic papers on the topic of online experimentation. He spoke at 30+ conferences, including Growth  Marketing Summit, CXL Live, and Google Catalyst Conference, SIGIR and KDD. 

        Currently Lukas is employed as Director of Experimentation at Vistaprint. He is also available as a freelance consultant to help businesses grow their experimentation culture.

I also served as a direct manager, a mentor, and a hiring manager for several key roles in my organisation.
        In the wider product and data science community within Booking.com I actively collaborated with key stakeholders to ensure our departmental goals were aligned with the rest of the organisation, and I worked with individual product leaders and product teams to enable them to quantify the impact of their product as well as reviewed critical business decisions.
