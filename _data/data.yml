    summary: |
        Lukas Vermeer is an experienced experimentation practitioner. His specialty is designing and building the infrastructure and processes required to start and scale A/B testing to drive business growth. 

        Lukas combines industry experience in online experimentation and data science with an academic background in computing science and machine learning. For eight years, he was responsible for A/B testing at Booking.com, widely acknowledged leader in online experimentation. Lukas grew the Booking.com in-house experimentation team from four to thirty people, and became the first Director of Experimentation in the company.

        Lukas plays an essential role in making A/B testing an integrated part of business processes. He is an advocate for accessibility of experimentation, helping people from any background (product owners, designers, developers, writers) to make the right decisions. His impact was recognised in the Harvard Business Review story "Building a Culture of Experimentation" (March - April 2020 issue).

        Lukas co-authored multiple influential academic papers on the topic of online experimentation. He spoke at 30+ conferences, including Growth  Marketing Summit, CXL Live, and Google Catalyst Conference, SIGIR and KDD. 

        Currently Lukas is employed as Director of Experimentation at Vistaprint. He is also available as a freelance consultant to help businesses grow their experimentation culture. 

        You can hire Lukas to help you find answers to questions such as: 
          - How do we start?
          - How do we scale?
          - What are the common pitfalls and mistakes in A/B testing and beyond? 
          - How to ensure that experimentation takes the right place in your company culture?
